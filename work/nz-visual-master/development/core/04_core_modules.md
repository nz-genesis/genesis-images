# CORE MODULES — COMPLETE SET (AI-NATIVE)

This document defines the **immutable core modules** of Visual Master.
Modules describe *capabilities and constraints*, not suggestions.

---

## MODULE GROUP A — MEANING & COGNITION

### 01. Meaning & Intent Grammar
Resolve explicit and implicit intent.
Lock non-negotiable meaning before visual translation.

### 02. Storytelling & Visual Dramaturgy
Select story axis (before / during / after).
Ensure one frame equals one story.

### 03. Conflict & Tension Grammar
Enforce presence of one dominant visible conflict.
Conflict must be readable without explanation.

### 04. Semantic Density Governor
Control amount of information readable per glance.
Prevent underload and overload.

### 05. Context-of-Use Grammar
Adapt decisions to platform, format, and viewing conditions.

## MODULE GROUP B — VISUAL CRAFT

### 06. Style Grammar
Select and constrain stylistic language.
Avoid unmotivated stylistic mixing.

### 07. Lighting & Shadow Grammar
Define light sources, direction, and contrast logically.
No decorative lighting without narrative role.

### 08. Camera & Viewpoint Grammar
Define camera position, lens logic, and viewer role.
No undefined or random viewpoints.

### 09. Composition & Visual Hierarchy
Enforce visual order and focal priority.
Remove competing focal points.

### 10. Anatomy, Balance & Pose
Ensure physical plausibility and balance.
Avoid impossible anatomy unless explicitly intended.

### 11. Emotion as Physical State
Express emotion only through posture, tension, and gesture.
Abstract emotions forbidden.

### 12. Material, Texture & Physics
Ensure materials behave physically correctly.
Avoid plastic or undefined surfaces.

### 13. Retouch, Noise & Imperfection
Introduce controlled imperfection for realism.
Avoid sterile AI appearance.

### 14. Typography in Space
Treat text as physical object in scene.
Ensure spatial logic and readability.

## MODULE GROUP C — CONTROL & RISK

### 15. Complexity Governor
Enforce minimal sufficient complexity.
Prevent unnecessary detail.

### 16. Risk & Anomaly Control
Anticipate common AI failures and mitigate them.

### 17. Reference Intelligence
Resolve reference hierarchy and conflicts.
References inform, not override intent.

### 18. Tool & Generator Literacy
Adapt output to capabilities and limits of tools.

---

## MODULE GROUP D — EVALUATION & EVOLUTION

### 19. Professional Quality Judgment
Evaluate output as senior human professional would.

### 20. Attention & Cognitive Load
Predict viewer attention flow.
Ensure readability within context time.

### 21. Audience & Cultural Context
Avoid cultural misinterpretation.
Adapt visual language to audience.

### 22. Identity & Continuity
Maintain consistency across iterations.
Prevent drift.

### 23. Failure Prediction (Pre-Mortem)

### 24. Explainable Creative Decisions
Maintain internal rationale for decisions.

### 25. Adaptive Intelligence & Control
Allow controlled learning without canon drift.
