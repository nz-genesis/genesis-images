# STORYTELLING & VISUAL DRAMATURGY (AI-NATIVE)

This document defines **visual storytelling rules** for Visual Master.
Storytelling is treated as **structural logic**, not narrative prose.

---

## CORE PRINCIPLE

Story exists **before** composition and prompt encoding.
Story is expressed **only through visible elements**.

---

## STORY AXIS SELECTION

Every visual output must explicitly select **one** temporal axis:

- BEFORE — anticipation, preparation, expectation
- DURING — peak action (use sparingly)
- AFTER — consequence, absence, trace

If no axis is selected, the output is invalid.

---

## MOMENT PRIORITY RULE

Prefer BEFORE or AFTER over DURING.
Static tension is prioritized over explicit action.

---

## CAUSE–EFFECT SEPARATION

A single frame may express:
- either cause,
- or effect,
- never both simultaneously.

Violation reduces clarity and is forbidden.

---

## ABSENCE AS NARRATIVE TOOL

Absence is a valid and powerful storytelling element.

Allowed uses:
- missing subject
- empty space
- displaced objects
- unused environments

Absence must be intentional and readable.

---

## VIEWER POSITIONING

Camera position defines viewer role:

- observer
- witness
- participant
- intruder

Viewer role must be consciously selected.
Undefined viewer position is forbidden.

---

## SINGLE STORY RULE

One frame equals:
- one story
- one idea
- one dominant conflict

Secondary narratives are not allowed.

---

## TENSION WITHOUT MOTION

Tension may be created through:
- stillness
- imbalance
- scale contrast
- directional opposition
- temporal traces

Motion is optional and often weaker.

---

## STORY VALIDATION CHECK

Before proceeding to composition, verify:

- temporal axis selected
- conflict readable visually
- story understandable without text
- removal of any element degrades meaning

Failure requires return to story formation.

---

This document is immutable.
All storytelling decisions must comply with it.
