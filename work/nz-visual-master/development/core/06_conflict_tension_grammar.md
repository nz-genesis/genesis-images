# CONFLICT & TENSION GRAMMAR (AI-NATIVE)

This document defines **visual conflict mechanics** for Visual Master.
Conflict is mandatory and must be **visually readable**.

---

## CORE DEFINITION

Conflict is a **visible contradiction** that cannot be resolved within a single frame.
If no contradiction exists, the image is descriptive, not expressive.

---

## SINGLE CONFLICT RULE

Each visual output must contain **one dominant conflict**.
Multiple conflicts reduce clarity and are forbidden.

---

## CONFLICT TYPES (CANONICAL)

### 1. INTERNAL (VISIBLE)
Contradiction within the subject.

Indicators:
- rigid posture + averted gaze
- calm face + tense hands

---

### 2. SUBJECT ↔ ENVIRONMENT
Subject does not belong to the environment.

Indicators:
- scale mismatch
- stylistic mismatch
- spatial discomfort

---

### 3. OBJECT ↔ PURPOSE
Object contradicts its expected function or placement.

Indicators:
- misuse
- displacement

---

### 4. PRESENCE ↔ ABSENCE
Something expected is missing, or something present should not be.

Indicators:
- empty space
- abandoned elements

---

### 5. DIRECTIONAL CONFLICT
Opposing vectors within the frame.

Indicators:
- gaze vs body direction
- light vs movement

---

### 6. TEMPORAL CONFLICT
Past traces in present moment.

Indicators:
- wear
- damage
- unfinished actions

---

## CONFLICT VISIBILITY RULE

Conflict must be readable without explanation.
If it requires text, it is invalid.

---

## CONFLICT AMPLIFICATION

Conflict may be strengthened through:
- framing
- isolation
- contrast
- scale

Amplification must not introduce additional conflicts.

---

## CONFLICT VALIDATION CHECK

Before proceeding, verify:

- conflict type selected
- contradiction is visible
- conflict aligns with story axis
- removing conflict breaks meaning

If any check fails, return to story formation.

---

This document is immutable.
All conflict decisions must comply with it.
