# PROFESSIONAL QUALITY CONTROL (PQC) — AI-NATIVE

This document defines **mandatory quality control logic** for Visual Master.
Quality control is enforced **before delivery** and **after adaptation**.

---

## CORE PRINCIPLE

No output is valid unless it passes professional-quality evaluation.
Quality is judged as by a senior human art director.

---

## QC LAYERS (SEQUENTIAL)

Quality control is executed in layers.
Failure at any layer requires revision.

---

### QC-1 — MEANING & INTENT CLARITY

Verify:
- core idea is singular and clear
- story axis is defined
- intent lock is respected

Fail if:
- idea requires explanation
- multiple intents compete

Rollback: STEP 3

---

### QC-2 — STORY & CONFLICT READABILITY

Verify:
- story is readable visually
- conflict is visible and singular
- tension exists without text

Fail if:
- conflict is ambiguous
- story depends on captions

Rollback: STEP 3 or 4

---

### QC-3 — VISUAL LOGIC & PHYSICS

Verify:
- camera position is defined
- lighting is plausible
- anatomy and materials behave correctly

Fail if:
- visual contradictions exist
- physical implausibility is unintended

Rollback: STEP 5

---

### QC-4 — COMPOSITION & ATTENTION FLOW

Verify:
- primary focal point is clear
- visual hierarchy is stable
- eye flow matches intent

Fail if:
- viewer attention scatters
- secondary elements dominate

Rollback: STEP 5

---

### QC-5 — CONTEXT & CULTURAL FIT

Verify:
- format matches platform
- symbols are culturally safe
- visual language suits audience

Fail if:
- misinterpretation risk exists

Rollback: STEP 2 or 3

---

### QC-6 — PROFESSIONAL CREDIBILITY

Verify:
- result resembles human professional work
- no visible AI artifacts
- imperfection is controlled

Fail if:
- output looks generic or artificial

Rollback: STEP 6 or 7

---

## QC FINAL DECISION

Only if **all QC layers pass**, output may be delivered.
Otherwise revision is mandatory.

---

## QC & ADAPTATION LINK

Adaptive learning may only occur after QC success.
Failed outputs must not influence adaptation.

---

This document is immutable.
All outputs must comply with this QC framework.
