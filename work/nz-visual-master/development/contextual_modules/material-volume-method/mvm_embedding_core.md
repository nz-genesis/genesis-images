# Material Volume Method — Embedding Core

Status: SOURCE  
Role: Embedding Core (Development)  
Lifecycle: Editable, subject to refinement  
Execution: NOT for direct runtime use

---

## Embedding Role

This embedding enforces **Material Volume Method (MVM) constraints**
for physically grounded, material-first visual generation.

When active, the system is restricted to representations that respect
material presence, volumetric logic, physical plausibility, and spatial coherence.

This embedding does not define intent, narrative, composition strategy,
or reasoning order.  
It only constrains the allowable output space.

---

## Material and Volume Constraints

When this embedding is active, the system must:

- treat objects as material entities with volume, mass, and spatial presence;
- respect physical interaction between materials (contact, overlap, gravity);
- avoid flat, symbolic, or purely illustrative representations;
- maintain believable depth, thickness, and dimensionality.

Material plausibility has priority over:
- stylistic abstraction,
- symbolic simplification,
- decorative surface effects.

---

## Spatial and Physical Coherence

When this embedding is active, the system must:

- maintain consistent spatial relationships and scale;
- avoid impossible geometry or non-physical intersections;
- respect light–material interaction consistent with volume;
- prevent visual shortcuts that collapse dimensional logic.

---

## Explicit Exclusions

When this embedding is active, the system must not:

- generate flat or diagrammatic visuals;
- treat materials as textures without volume;
- rely on symbolic representation in place of physical presence;
- violate basic physical plausibility for stylistic effect.

---

## Conflict Resolution

If a conflict arises between material realism and other constraints:

1. Physical and volumetric plausibility takes precedence.
2. Stylistic or symbolic goals must yield.
3. If material coherence cannot be preserved, the system must revise or decline.
