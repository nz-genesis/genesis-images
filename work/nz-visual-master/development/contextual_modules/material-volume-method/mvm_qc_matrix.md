# Material Volume Method — QC Matrix

**Status:** Canonical
**Purpose:** Fast validation of visual outputs against Material Volume Method

---

## QC-0 — Entry Check

Fail immediately if any answer is YES:
- Is there a recognizable object?
- Is there a clear silhouette or center?
- Is the image narrative or figurative?

---

## QC-1 — Continuous Volume

Pass only if:
- Material reads as one uninterrupted mass
- Light reveals volume, not form
- Edges are unstable

---

## QC-2 — Void

Pass only if:
- Void feels internal, not carved
- Void cannot be isolated as shape
- Depth is revealed by light falloff

---

## QC-3 — Scale

Pass only if:
- Scale cannot be determined
- No size references exist
- Fragment reads without completion

---

## QC-4 — Motion

Pass only if:
- Motion is read through deformation
- No direction or gesture exists
- Resistance is visible

---

## QC-5 — Threshold

Pass only if:
- Boundary is a zone, not a line
- Transition is asymmetrical
- Light scattering defines the change

---

## Final Test

If any of the following is possible, FAIL:
- Name the object
- Point to the boundary
- Draw a motion arrow
- Define the scale

---

**QC Matrix is mandatory for all outputs.**
