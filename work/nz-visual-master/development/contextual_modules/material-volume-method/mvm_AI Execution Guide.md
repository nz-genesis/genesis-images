# Material Volume Method — Operator Guide

**Purpose:** Daily practical use of MVM without canon drift

---

## Operator Mindset

You are not creating an image.
You are maintaining a material state.

If you think in terms of objects or forms, stop.

---

## Universal Anchor Prompt

```
Abstract non-narrative material composition.
A single continuous material body.
No object, no construction.
Material behavior defines the image.
Light reveals density and volume.
No symmetry, no scale indicators.
```

## Module Usage Rules

### Void
- Internal cavities only
- Never holes or cut-outs

### Scale
- Fragment over whole
- Remove all context

### Motion
- Deformation only
- Never flow or direction

### Threshold
- Zone, not edge
- Light-driven transition

---

## Model Usage

### Flux
- Primary research model
- Accept instability

### Banana
- Diagnostic only
- Detect object bias

Rule:
If Banana makes it look finished — revise.

## Common Failure Signals

- "Beautiful" → object risk
- "Looks like X" → scale fixed
- Clear edge → threshold failed
- Flowing motion → gesture detected

---

## 30-Second Check

Fail if any answer is YES:
- Is it an object?
- Is it complete?
- Is motion directional?
- Is scale readable?
