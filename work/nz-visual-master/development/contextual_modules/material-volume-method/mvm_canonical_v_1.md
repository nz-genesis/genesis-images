# Material Volume Method (MVM)

**Status:** Canonical
**Version:** v1.0
**Purpose:** Stable, operational visual method for AI‑native material research

---

## 0. Scope & Positioning

Material Volume Method is a **non‑narrative, non‑object‑centric** visual method focused on **material states** rather than forms, scenes, or subjects.

The method is:
- **Over‑model** (Flux, Banana, others interpret it differently)
- **Anti‑object** by design
- **Process‑oriented**, not compositional
- **Operational**, not inspirational

The method is *not* intended for:
- characters
- storytelling
- illustration
- symbolic imagery

## 1. Core Axioms (Immutable)

1. **Material precedes form**
2. **Form is always secondary and unstable**
3. **Light defines material identity**
4. **Void, scale, motion, and threshold are states — not features**
5. **If it becomes an object, the method has failed**

---

## 2. Module 01 — Material as Continuous Volume

### Principle
A material body is treated as **one uninterrupted mass**, regardless of deformation.

Allowed:
- erosion
- deformation
- surface instability

Forbidden:
- blocks
- assembly
- modular logic

### Anchor Prompt
```
Abstract non-narrative composition.
A single continuous material body.
No construction, no assembly.
Light reveals volume and material behavior.
Form is secondary and unstable.
```

## 3. Module 02 — Material / Void

### Definition
Void is an **internal state of matter**, formed by process, not subtraction.

Void must:
- belong to the material
- resist isolation as shape
- be revealed only through light

Failure condition:
> If the void can be extracted as a form, the module fails.

---

## 4. Module 03 — Material / Scale

### Definition
Scale is treated as **cognitive instability**, not size.

Valid state:
- viewer cannot determine scale

Invalid state:
- object recognition
- pattern repetition
- contextual anchors

Rule:
> Fragment over whole.

---

## 5. Module 04 — Material / Motion

### Definition
Motion is a **trace of internal deformation**, not action.

Motion appears through:
- compression
- strain
- displacement

Forbidden:
- flow
- direction
- gesture

Rule:
> If a vector can be drawn, motion has failed.

---

## 6. Module 05 — Material / Threshold

### Definition
Threshold is a **volumetric transition zone** between material states.

Valid threshold:
- has thickness
- is asymmetrical
- is revealed by light scattering

Invalid threshold:
- line
- edge
- clean gradient

Rule:
> If the boundary can be pointed at, the module fails.

---

## 7. Model Usage Doctrine

### Flux
- Primary research model
- Tolerates instability
- Best for void, scale, threshold

### Banana
- Diagnostic model
- Detects object bias
- Never final authority

Rule:
> If Banana makes it look finished — something is wrong.

---

## 8. Canonical QC Matrix (Summary)

An output is valid **only if all answers are NO**:

- Is it an object?
- Does it have a clear scale?
- Can the boundary be pointed at?
- Does motion have direction?
- Is it “beautiful” or finished?

---

## 9. Operational Cycle

1. Generate in Flux
2. Check against QC
3. Stress‑test in Banana
4. Remove object cues
5. Repeat

---

## 10. Final Principle

> Material Volume Method does not generate images.
> It maintains material states under pressure.
