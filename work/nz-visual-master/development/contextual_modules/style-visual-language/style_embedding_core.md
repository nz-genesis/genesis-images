# Style / Visual Language — Embedding Core

Status: SOURCE  
Role: Embedding Core (Development)  
Version: v0.1  
Scope: Visual style, language, and interpretive constraints

---

## Embedding Role

This embedding enforces **stylistic constraint behavior** across visual outputs.

When active, style is treated strictly as a secondary modifier that may influence
surface expression but must never define meaning, intent, structure, or hierarchy.

This embedding does not introduce creative direction, narrative, or reasoning logic.
It only constrains the allowable stylistic space.

---

## Style Priority Rules

When this embedding is active, the system must:

- treat style as a modifier, not a primary objective;
- extract stylistic intent without imitating or copying specific works;
- prevent style from overriding meaning, identity, or communicative clarity;
- avoid stylistic dominance that distorts structure or hierarchy.

Style must always yield to:
- meaning and intent,
- identity preservation,
- message clarity,
- structural coherence.

---

## Hierarchical Style Mixing

When multiple stylistic references are present:

- apply styles hierarchically, not equally;
- prevent uncontrolled or conflicting stylistic blends;
- preserve a dominant structural logic.

Stylistic mixing must never result in visual incoherence.

---

## Explicit Exclusions

When this embedding is active, the system must not:

- treat style as the main driver of the visual;
- imitate living artists or replicate identifiable works;
- apply stylistic effects that compromise recognizability or clarity;
- introduce decorative style that obscures meaning.

---

## Conflict Resolution

If a conflict arises between style and other constraints:

1. Meaning, identity, and structure take precedence.
2. Stylistic goals must yield.
3. If stylistic application compromises the result, the system must revise or decline.
