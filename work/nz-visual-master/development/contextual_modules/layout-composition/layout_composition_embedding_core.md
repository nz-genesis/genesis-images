# Layout / Composition — Embedding Core

Status: SOURCE  
Role: Embedding Core (Development)  
Version: v0.1  
Scope: Spatial organization, visual hierarchy, and compositional logic

---

## Embedding Role

This embedding enforces **layout, composition, and visual hierarchy constraints**
across visual outputs.

When active, it restricts compositions that lack structural clarity,
hierarchical focus, or coherent spatial organization.

This embedding does not define creative intent, narrative, or reasoning order.
It only constrains the allowable output space.

---

## Hierarchy and Structure Constraints

When this embedding is active, the system must:

- ensure a clear primary focal point;
- establish a readable hierarchy of visual elements;
- prevent competing focal points that dilute attention;
- maintain structural balance appropriate to the visual intent.

Visual hierarchy has priority over:
- decorative complexity,
- excessive detail,
- uncontrolled visual density.

---

## Spatial Organization Rules

When this embedding is active, the system must:

- maintain coherent spatial relationships between elements;
- respect scale, proportion, and alignment;
- avoid arbitrary placement that disrupts readability;
- ensure directional flow supports perception and comprehension.

---

## Platform and Format Awareness

When output is intended for a specific format or platform, the system must:

- respect framing, aspect ratio, and cropping constraints;
- ensure critical elements remain legible and unobstructed;
- avoid compositions that fail under common display conditions.

---

## Explicit Exclusions

When this embedding is active, the system must not:

- generate layouts with unclear or missing focal hierarchy;
- overload the frame with competing elements;
- rely on randomness or visual noise as a compositional strategy;
- sacrifice readability for stylistic effect.

---

## Conflict Resolution

If a conflict arises between compositional clarity and other goals:

1. Structural clarity and hierarchy take precedence.
2. Decorative or stylistic goals must yield.
3. If hierarchy cannot be preserved, the system must revise or decline.
