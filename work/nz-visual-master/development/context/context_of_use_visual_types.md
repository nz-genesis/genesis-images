# Context-of-Use — Visual Types

Status: DEV / SOURCE  
Scope: Context-of-use classification  
Affects: QC logic, conflict form, readability expectations  
Does NOT affect: Execution Core, embeddings, reasoning depth

---

## Purpose

This document defines **types of visual production** used by Visual Master
to correctly interpret context-of-use during STEP 2–3 of the pipeline.

Visual types:
- are NOT styles,
- are NOT genres,
- are NOT embeddings.

They describe **professional production context** and
influence quality control and acceptable visual logic.

## Primary Axis — Narrative Presence

### A. Narrative Visuals

Visuals with an implied temporal axis and cause–effect relationship.

Properties:
- story axis required (before / after preferred)
- visible conflict mandatory
- viewer positioning required

Examples:
- illustration
- cinematic / film / game frames
- narrative editorial
- story-driven concept art

---

### B. Non-Narrative Visuals

Visuals without story progression.
Meaning is conveyed through structure, function, identity, or form.

Properties:
- no story axis required
- conflict may be structural or systemic
- clarity and stability prioritized

Examples:
- design
- branding
- graphics
- typography
- architecture
- technical visualization
- material studies (MVM)

---

### C. Dependent / Service Visuals

Visuals that cannot exist as primary meaning carriers.

Properties:
- always subordinate
- inherit context and QC from host visual
- cannot define story or intent

Examples:
- VFX
- motion elements
- UI micro-visuals

---

## Canonical Visual Types

### Illustration / Art
Interpretive visual expression.
May be narrative or non-narrative.

---

### 3D / CGI
Digitally constructed spatial visuals.
Requires material coherence, light logic, and spatial plausibility.

---

### Design
Function-driven visuals prioritizing hierarchy, usability, and clarity.

---

### Graphics
Symbolic or abstract visual communication.

---

### Branding
Visual identity maintained across time and contexts.
Primary goal: recognizability and repeatability.

---

### Advertising
Short-term persuasive visuals.
Message clarity overrides aesthetics.

---

### Editorial
Interpretive visuals accompanying ideas or texts.
Must remain readable without captions.

---

### Architecture
Spatial and structural visuals.
Scale and construction logic are mandatory.

---

### Technical / Scientific Visualization
Precision-driven visuals.
Ambiguity and artistic interpretation are forbidden.

---

### Typography / Text-in-Space
Visuals where text is a spatial and semantic object.
Typography is NOT a subset of graphics.

---

### Material Studies (MVM)
Non-narrative volumetric and material exploration.

---

### VFX / Effects (Dependent)
Visual effects serving another visual context.

---

## Integration Notes

- Visual type is resolved during STEP 2–3.
- Visual types influence QC and conflict form.
- They do NOT activate embeddings or alter the Execution Core.
