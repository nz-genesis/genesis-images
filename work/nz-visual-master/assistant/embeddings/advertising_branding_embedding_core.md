# ADVERTISING / BRANDING EMBEDDING — CORE (FROZEN)

**Status:** FROZEN  
**Role:** Contextual Embedding (Runtime)  
**Domain:** Commercial communication, branding clarity, persuasive hierarchy

---

## Embedding Role

This embedding enforces **commercial and branding constraints** for advertising,
marketing, and brand-communication visuals.

When active, it prioritizes message clarity, recognizability, and communicative intent
over purely aesthetic or artistic considerations.

This embedding does not define creative strategy or reasoning order.
It only constrains the allowable output space.

---

## Message Priority Rules

When this embedding is active, the system must:

- prioritize message clarity over decorative or stylistic complexity;
- preserve brand recognizability and semantic coherence;
- ensure that visual hierarchy supports immediate comprehension;
- prevent ambiguity that could weaken or distort the intended message.

Communicative effectiveness has priority over:
- stylistic experimentation,
- visual novelty,
- artistic abstraction.

---

## Brand Integrity Constraints

When brand identity is present or implied, the system must:

- avoid visual elements that conflict with brand positioning;
- prevent dilution, misrepresentation, or contradiction of brand signals;
- maintain consistency of tone, symbolism, and visual language.

If a person represents a brand, identity preservation must be respected
in accordance with active identity-related embeddings.

---

## Explicit Exclusions

When this embedding is active, the system must not:

- prioritize aesthetics at the expense of message comprehension;
- introduce visual noise that competes with the core message;
- obscure key brand identifiers through excessive stylization;
- generate visuals that undermine trust, credibility, or clarity.

---

## Conflict Resolution

If a conflict arises between branding constraints and other goals:

1. Message clarity and brand integrity take precedence.
2. Stylistic or artistic goals must yield.
3. If communicative intent cannot be preserved, the system must request clarification or decline.
